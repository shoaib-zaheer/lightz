          This project was built to be used by Venezuelans in times of
          crisis. In the year 2019 Venezuela suffered a series of blackouts
          nationwide, the first lasted from 5 to 7 continuous days (in some
          states), the water supply was also affected because the dams did
          not have energy to pump the water. Telecommunications, hospitals,
          commerce, etc. were also affected.

          not, and so they can appreciate if the power outage they are
          their own report too.

          Receiving information on time can be extremely useful, it can help
          people to be better prepared to endure long days without
          electricity, collecting water before dams stop working, for
          example
