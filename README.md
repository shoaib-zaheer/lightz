# Do you have electricity?

## Description:

This project was built to be used by Venezuelans in times of crisis, consists of a webpage that shows the user the reports of the places where there is electricity and where there is not.

## Motivation:

In the year 2019 Venezuela suffered a series of blackouts nationwide, the first lasted from 5 to 7 continuous days (in some states), the water supply was also affected because the dams did not have energy to pump the water. Telecommunications, hospitals, commerce, etc. were also affected.

The purpose of this app is for users to easily see the list of reports of places where there is electricity and where there is not, that way they can see if the power outage they are experiencing is a problem in their area or nationally, they can make their own report too.

Receiving information on time can be extremely useful, it can help people to be better prepared to endure long days without electricity, collecting water before dams stop working, for example.
